                <p>Hello, my name is Paul Dyerson and I am a self-taught Front End Developer. I'm originally from London England and emigrated to Canada in 2021, while waiting for my permanent recidency I dedicated a couple of months to learning how to code.
                   I had no prior knowledge of web development and so took it upon myself to find free resources to teach myself.
                </p>
                <p>On my journey I discovered freecodecamp and finsihed their responsive we development course, I then moved onto Scrimba where I learned the basics of Javascript. Most recently I finished Harvards CS50 course.
                    I fell in love with coding as it scratched a creative itch that I have. I studied fine art in London and have always had a passion for creating. I see this next step as me taking the leap from canvas to keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like fine art this is an industry in which I can continue to learn and master my craft. There is always something new to discover or a more efficient way to do something and I am excited to see what the future holds!
                </p>
